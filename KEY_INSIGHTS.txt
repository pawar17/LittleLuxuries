KEY INSIGHTS FROM RECESSION INDICATORS ANALYSIS
======================================================================

HYPOTHESIS 1: Does Consumer Behavior Follow the 'Lipstick Effect'?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[REJECTED] Traditional Lipstick Index shows NO significant relationship
   - R-squared: 0.0037% (essentially zero)
   - P-value: 0.9238 (not significant)
[SUPPORTED] 7 out of 7 other indicators ARE significant
   - Average R-squared: 9.75%
   - Conclusion: The 'lipstick' has evolved to fashion trends, not cosmetics

HYPOTHESIS 2: How Has 'Treatonomics' Evolved Beyond Traditional Categories?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[CONFIRMED] Modern 'little luxuries' have shifted categories
   - Accessories: 12.44% avg R² (2 significant indicators)
   - Fashion Trends: 8.68% avg R² (5 significant indicators)
   - Beauty & Cosmetics: 0.00% avg R² (0 significant indicators)
   - Top category: Fashion Trends (strongest predictors)
   - Bottom category: Beauty & Cosmetics (traditional 'lipstick' failed)

HYPOTHESIS 3: Can Fashion Trends Predict Economic Sentiment?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[STRONGLY SUPPORTED] 7 out of 8 indicators are significant predictors

Top 3 Predictors:
   1. Mini: 17.42% variance (p=4.85e-12)
   2. Bigbag: 15.43% variance (p=1.01e-10)
   3. Indiesleaze: 11.36% variance (p=4.13e-08)

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Inverse Relationship
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All significant indicators show NEGATIVE correlations:
  - When fashion trend searches INCREASE -> Consumer confidence DECREASES
  - This contradicts traditional 'Lipstick Effect' theory
  - Suggests: Search behavior != Purchase behavior
  - Interpretation: People browse more when anxious, but may not buy

IMPLICATIONS FOR PROJECT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Search Trends vs. Purchase Data:
   - Current analysis uses Google Trends (search behavior)
   - Need to compare with actual purchase data (retail sales)
   - This will reveal if browsing translates to buying

2. The 'New Lipstick':
   - Fashion items (mini skirts, blazers) are stronger than beauty
   - Accessories (big bags, high heels) show significant relationships
   - Price point may matter: affordable luxuries dominate

3. Predictive Power:
   - Mini Skirts: 17.4% variance explained (strongest predictor)
   - Could serve as leading indicator of economic sentiment
   - Lag analysis needed to test predictive timing
